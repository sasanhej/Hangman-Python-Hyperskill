# Hangman-Python-Hyperskill
This is "Hangman (Python)" project form Hyperskill.<br>
With functions, loops, lists and other variables, this is a great project for Python basics. As a cherry on top, it even includes a random module. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages; they ensure that your dive into Python is safe and smooth.<br>
Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
